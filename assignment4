# Final Story Pitch**

### With more people staying at home in the COVID-19 quarantine, the use of social media has grown especially as trends about baking bread, or growing a victory garden gain followers. Seeing the popularity around these videos grow, I would like to document the kind of diversity they portray. How often do these accounts showcase hands of a different skin color or body type? 
To do this, I would like to create a database on the videos of 5 top instagram handles that produce cooking videos. I would create an image database and excel sheet to document how the kind of diversity at play with these videos. 
For perspective, I would like to interview experts on media studies and colorism to gain a full perspective of the unconscious bias that may be creeping in. 
I would also like to interview the creators of these videos to understand how they navigate this issue or if they even think about it. 
As discussed, for the visualization, I would work with photoshop to get the color scheme and create an array of photographs to let the readers decide for themselves rather than present an a direct analysis of my findings.

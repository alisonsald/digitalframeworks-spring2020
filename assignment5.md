For this assignment, I downloaded the the Federal Election Commission's data for 2019 data on ll transactions (contributions, transfers, etc. among federal committees). I downloaded the header data separately.

Since these originally cleaned files were to heavy to upload onto github I limited the rows to 64. 

The original data is saved here: [Link](https://github.com/alisonsald/digitalframeworks-spring2020/blob/master/Original%20data_FEC%202019%20(shortened).csv)

The cleaned data is saved here : [Link](https://github.com/alisonsald/digitalframeworks-spring2020/blob/master/Cleaned%20data_FEC%20(shortened).csv)

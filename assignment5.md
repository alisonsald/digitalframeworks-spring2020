For this assignment, I downloaded the the Federal Election Commission's data for 2019 data on ll transactions (contributions, transfers, etc. among federal committees). I downloaded the header data separately.
Since these originally cleaned files were to heavy to upload onto github I limited the rows to 64. 
The original data is saved here: [Link](digitalframeworks-spring2020/Original data_FEC 2019 (shortened).csv)
The cleaned data is saved here : [Link](digitalframeworks-spring2020/Cleaned data_FEC (shortened).csv)

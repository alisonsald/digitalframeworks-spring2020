**Interviewing the data** 

For this assignment I chose the Colorado state government data on COVID-19 clusters. 
https://covid19.colorado.gov/data/outbreak-data

**I asked the questions:** 
1. How many clusters has Colorado identified?
Answer: 206 clusters
2. What is the total number of “confirmed” Covid-19 cases and deaths reported at these? How many are probable?
Answer: 4667 confirmed cases and 547 deaths. There are also 1443 probable cases and 126 probable deaths linked to Covid-19. 
3. How many cases and deaths are tied to prisons or jails?
Answer: 16.8%

For this, I downloaded and put this data on a google sheet here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JkCVRDl8Wd1QPri62PfCe7SLbrxFCRitn_lUx9GTL0A/edit?usp=sharing
I then froze the top row so that I could see the headers as I scrolled down. 

I selected the column with facility names and hit Command to deselect the header. This gave me the count of clusters listed. 

I then highlighted the columns reporting probably cases and deaths to exclude these. 

I then entered the sum formula to add all the cases and deaths in the confirmed columns

From the totals for each column I added the combined total using the Sum formula again

I ended up highlighting the confirmed deaths, probable deaths and probable cases in different colors too and then managed to sum up probables easily

For the final question I created a filter on Column D for setting type. I unchecked all the other settings except for “Prison/jail”

I then selected all the data and pasted it in a sheet. I then summed up the values for the columns on confirmed and probable cases of residents and staff and deaths. 

I then unfiltered the first sheet and took the total number of confirmed cases and with the sum total of confirmed cases for prisons, I calculated the percentage of COVID-19 cases that are tied to prisons or jails, and reduced it to one decimal point giving me 16.8%.

**HEADLINE: In Colorado, 1 in 6 COVID-19 cases from outbreaks tied to prisons and jails**

*LEDE:* In Colorado, one in six COVID-19 cluster cases are tied to prisons and jails, show latest available state data from May 13, 2020. Across 12 prisons and jails in seven counties, 783 persons have tested positive for the virus and 750 or 96% of these patients are inmates.

# STORY IDEAS FOR DIGITAL FRAMEWORKS (Assignment 1)
*by Alison Saldanha*

## 1. Impact of COVID-19 on prisons/ jails across the U.S.

### My first story idea is to compare cases of COVID-19 in jails across the U.S. with local data on the spread of the disease to get an overall understanding of how inmates are affected. I would also like to look at how these DOC facilities operate: what is the occupancy rate? What kind of charges do the inmates hold? Specifically, I would like to know how many pretrial detentions were held at these facilities, and on what charges. I could limit these to the top five crowded jails in the U.S. to start off and then may consider expanding to other areas depending on how easy/ difficult it is to get the data I am looking for.  I was inspired to do this looking at this project by the New York Times and the Marshall Project which captured the movement in and out of jails across the U.S.

**Clarity and accuracy** 
1. Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate?	4
2. Was it in the headline?	Yes, it was further made clear in the blurb
3. Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? 	3
4. Was that the most efficient way to navigate?	Yes
5. Can you suggest ways to improve navigation?	The on-click responsiveness is a bit temperamental. I would suggest, the data remain on screen when you click on a county jail until you move to click on another point
6. Do you think the data was accurate? 	4
7. List sources you would suggest the reporter check with.	Local county sherrif's offices
8. Did they provide a source?	Yes
9. Did they explain everything that needed explaining?	Yes

**Quality**
1. Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality?	5

2. Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made.	Some jails have larger populations than movement but this is not very visible on the map, I would suggest using a different color scheme or more distinctive border to show this

3. Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate Did this graphic accomplish all tasks? If not, which ones did it not accomplish? 
While the story does well on presenting, comparing, and organizing data, I don't think it did a successful job in correlation. That's not necessarily a bad thing since it's early to make correlations perhaps.

**Type and color (if piece includes graphics)**
1. Did it look like it all belonged together?	Yes
2. Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information?	Yes
3. Type on 1-5: 4
4. Color on 1-5 : 4
5. Did it make sense?	
Yes, an orange for entering into jails and a purple-ish blue as an opposite for outflow worked well, though I would may be use green (like the traffic signal)

**Creativity**
1. Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? Yes, I like the movement of population flow visualization on the map, I wish it would replay more often though because it happens within seconds and if you missed it because you were scrolling for the story, you're not likely to understand what they were trying to do until you clip on the map. 

2. On a scale of 1-5:	3

## Racial impact of COVID-19

### Since states have begun releasing data on the racial make-up of COVID-19 cases, I would like to see how the disease has impacted different populations in terms of infections and deaths. I could collect this information state-wise and compare this with demographic data for the states to see if certain communities are impacted more and how much more. I would further try to overlay census data on these demographics for these states like occupation/ income levels  to draw more insights. I was inspired to do this looking at this story in the New York Times that analyses movements based on cellular data to track which communities are more like to stay at home during the pandemic.

**Clarity and accuracy**
1. Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate?	5
2. Was it in the headline?	Yes, it was further made clear in the blurb
3. Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? 	5
4. Was that the most efficient way to navigate?	Yes
5. Can you suggest ways to improve navigation?	Maybe add color schemes to indicate low and high income disparity. At first glance you miss the difference between the two clusters of data visualizations in the story
6. Do you think the data was accurate? 	4
7. List sources you would suggest the reporter check with.	This was a very unique project undertaking, so no
8. Did they provide a source?	Yes
9. Did they explain everything that needed explaining?	Yes

**Quality**
1. Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality?	5
2. Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made.	Adding more color to the story, as I mentioned earlier
3. Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate Did this graphic accomplish all tasks?If not, which ones did it not accomplish?	
Yes, the story is honestly one of my favourites using data innovatively to understand what's happening on the ground with the coronavirus when there is such a dearth of information. I would have added more information on racial demographics based on this analysis but at the time the story was released, this data was not available. 

**Type and color (if piece includes graphics)**
1. Did it look like it all belonged together?	Yes
2. Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information?	Yes
3. Type on 1-5:	5
4. Color on 1-5:	2
5. Did it make sense?	
Yes, I would just add more colors and maybe blocks/ borders to distinguish the different places and the clusters of low and high income disparity 

**Creativity**
Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? 	Yes, I think the chart was simple but effective. The creativity was in the data used to track down something like this
